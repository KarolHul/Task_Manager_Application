# Task Manager Application
The Task Manager Application is a Java-based project that allows users to efficiently manage their tasks and to-do lists. Whether you want to keep track of daily responsibilities, manage projects, or create task lists, this application provides a user-friendly interface to help you stay organized.

## Features
**Task Creation:** Users can easily add new tasks to the application. Each task includes a title, description, due date, and priority level.

**Task Editing:** Edit existing tasks to modify titles, descriptions, due dates, and priorities.

**Task Deletion:** Remove tasks that have been completed or are no longer needed.

**Task List:** View a list of tasks in an organized user interface. Sort tasks by priority or due date.

**Notifications:** Receive notifications for upcoming task deadlines.

**Data Persistence:** Tasks are saved in a database or file, allowing users to access their tasks even after restarting the application.

**Security and Authentication:** If extended to a web or mobile application, implement user authentication and secure access to tasks.
